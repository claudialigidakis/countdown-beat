# Countdown Beat

It is a stop watch that automatically sets a song to the countdown. The user is able to specify the time and set it to their requested song on loop. 

# Motivation
I was in class with an instructor that would repeatedly set a timer whether it was for group work, individual work, or even just breaks. I thought it would be so much better if there was a song that would play with the timer (like final countdown) so I set out to create it with my five weeks of Javascript knowledge.

# Set Up
